        parasyte is one of the best first anime's in my opinion cus it has everything action,suspense,
        horror and the  best thing,its only 24 eps (available in sub and dub) its a great series , main 
        plot of parasyte is that a parasyte tries invading the main character's (shinichi) body and fails
        so both shinichi and the parasyte are in the same body they fight together agaisnt other parasytes
        and overall its worth watching</font>

        <font face="none" size="20">Tokyo ghoul is a great and badass anime its bacically
        About a boy whos friend was a ghoul and she tried eating kaneki(the main character)and
        she made kaneki a ghoul too so , the anime is about his journy after how he became
        strong as a ghoul and much more its also worth watching.
